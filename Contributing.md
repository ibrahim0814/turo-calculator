# Contributing to Turo Calculator

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the Turo Earnings Calculator. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Setup

This project uses Gatsby 4. It's still in beta, but technically so is this project.

You can use npm to install all the modules you need:

```npm install```

Then run Gatsby with the following command:

``` gatsby develop ```

This will open up a local development port and you're set!

### What should I work on?

Here's a running list of features that need to be added:

1. Add options for people who've bought/own their car completely
2. Add options for people who've financed their car
3. Add more fine grained operating costs
4. Add ability to factor in one time costs (ex: car skin)
